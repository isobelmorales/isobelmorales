# Hello, I'm Isobel 

## a software engineer with a professional background as an Executive Assistant at a proptech startup. In my professional experience, Iâ€™ve gained collaborational skills with cross-functional teams and Iâ€™ve learned how to communicate effectively with individuals with technical and non-technical backgrounds. My cross-functional collaboration and communication skills serve as strong assets to my software engineering skill set and I look forward to continuing working on innovative teams to solve complex problems.
